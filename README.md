# [hawtio](https://hawt.io/) for [docker](https://docker.com/)

We struggled to find an easy [docker](https://docker.com/) container for
[hawtio](https://hawt.io/) so we built this one.

## To use hawtio docker

```
docker run --rm -it -p 8081:8080 hawtio
```

Then you will be able to head along to:
